#Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the project.
The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
###Files
The code takes for granted all the data is present in the data folder, un-compressed and without names altered.
- **CodeBook.md** describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
- **run_analysis.R** contains all the code to perform the analysis.

The output of the script is called result.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
